COVBOT
Health & Social Care Volunteer Covid Surveillance 
Concept

Facebook chatbot for push Covid-19 Facebook Profile Status Update. health and social care volunteering platforms can pull Facebook profile status via usual Facebook API and harvest Covid Status with real-time volunteering account suspension and contact tracing. Facebook  Volunteer Groups can require daily update for group membership and also use the Bot to temporarily suspend group membership and send advice for self isolation.

Problem

●	Coronavirus is spreading exponentially across the world,
●	Yet there is no serology test yet on the market.
●	Various mathematical simulations of viral spread lead to dramatically different strategies of public health-related action.
●	Western countries have abandoned both testing and contact tracing (a least in mildly symptomatic cases) if disease

Complication

A number of apps/developments have been proposed and even developed to do crowd surveillance however all require going on a website. Now the UK and other western countries have entered lockdown. The chances of spread are restricted to

●	Transgressions of the rules
●	Shopping or essential trips
●	Critical sector workforce who remain working
●	volunteers

200,000 volunteers have now been recruited to help deliver services for the NHS to vulnerable people. Key workers and volunteers now present the greatest risk for transmitting COVID-19 between themselves, NHS staff and the people they are helping/

Solution

We propose a Facebook chatbot that will: 
1.	Updates a users Profile with their Covid Status 

The Covid status will be accessible over the standard Facebook API for platforms/apps which are designed to match Volunteers with recipients of help.  Facebook groups such as (Edin that also facilitate volunteering can use the bot to broadcast a daily request for current health status and temporarily block membership to the group when the status is COVID symptom positive.  They can also match vol

Data that is collected : 
●	Status re volunteering
●	Health status
●	Where health status changes support to crowd contact trace
●	Educational chatbot tool showing people how many risky interactions they have had so they can make



Design workflow 
 
1.	person logs on to facebook
2.	chatbot asks if you want to update covid status
3.	chatbot and person have a text conversation
4.	status is updated  (details about you on the profile)
5.	alternatively profile picture has covid positive background
6.	API with covid status is available to external platforms which match volunteers with high risk groups ie. NHS volunteers in the UK
7.	Partner matching platfrom  Bubble demonstrator for babysitting volunteersPlatform now has real time update of volunteer (and possibly) recipient covid stat

 


 
Later development

1.	Support external volunteer Platforms such as bubble  to contact trace positive volunteers using social graph algorithms
a.	geolocation of covid positive
b.	text message to close contacts
c.	transaction analysis on trains/buses/food purchases
d.	googlmap from a phone
2.	Allow external platforms such as bubble to update facebook covid status from data from their platform via Facebook API
